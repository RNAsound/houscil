Houscil~ (PD external)
====
Created by: Aren Akian

Last updated: Jul 30, 2024


## About
 - _Houscil~_ is a Pure Data (PD) external written in C, built on top of the PD “vanilla” library

- _Houscil~_, short for _Houscillator_, is a 7th chord harmonic generator, creating a tone often used in House music

- _Houscil~_ generates a sin signal, and a 7th chord using harmonics (amount controlled by second inlet) 


## Installation
To use _Houscil~_, you need to install the correct compiled binary for your system, in your PD externals folder. 

    - Mac (any 64 bit architecture): .pd_Darwin

    - Linux (any 64 bit architecture): .pd_linux

    - Windows (any 64 bit architecture): .dll

1. Find the location your PD externals folder
    - Open PD > Preferences > Path to see the default path to your externals folder 

2. Copy the _"houscil~"_ folder containing the compiled binaries and the _houscil~-help.pd_ files into the externals folder

Typically, the default externals path is as follows:
        
### macOS:

| Scope | Path |
| ------ | ------- |
| Application-specific: |  /$PdPath/Contents/Resources/extra (this is inside the Pd Application (like Pd-0.49-1 in ~/Applications); right click it and choose "Show Package Contents", then navigate to "Resources/extra") |
| User-specific: |  ~/Library/Pd (/Users/user_name/Library/Pd) |
| Global: |  /Library/Pd

### Windows
| Scope | Path |
| ------ | ------- |
| Application-specific: | %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Pd\extra (for 64-bit OS and 32-bit Pd) or %ProgramFiles%\Pd\extra; this is inside the Pd Application (usually in C:\Program Files). This folder needs to be set to writeable.
| User-specific: | %AppData%\Pd (usually in C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Pd).
| Global: | %CommonProgramFiles%\Pd (usually in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Pd).

### GNU/Linux

| Scope | Path |
| ------ | ------- |
| Application-specific: |  /usr/lib/pd/extra if installed via a package manager (apt-get) or /usr/local/lib/pd/extra if compiled by yourself.
| User-specific: | ~/.local/lib/pd/extra (preferred since version Pd-0.47-1) or ~/pd-externals (deprecated but still usable).
| Global: | /usr/local/lib/pd-externals.

In most cases, the “User-Specific” path is reccomended.
- If unsure, you can add a search path to your custom install location. 



How to Run
=======

1. Open a PD project
2. Inside the patcher, create a new object (⇧⌘ + 1 or ⇧Ctl + 1) 
    - type in "_houscil~_”  


How to Use
=======
1. Follow the steps above to create a _houscil~_ object. Connect the outlet to a _dac~_ or other outlet for further processing
2. Send a signal value to the first inlet, setting the frequency of _houscil~_
3. Then send number values to the second inlet, denoting the amount of 7th harmonic to add to the generated tone
4. For examples or further help, open “_houscil~-help.pd_” included in this repo.

Inputs & Message Prototypes
===

### Inlet~ 1: Root Frequency
**Info:** Inlet 1 accepts a signal input, corresponding to the root frequency of the tone generated by _houscil~_

**Arguments:** 
- _Frequency~_ - the frequency of the root note
    - _Tip_: use an _mtof_ object to send frequency values into a _sig~_ object, then connect the _sig~_ outlet to the first inlet of _houscil~_ (like in the _houscil~-help.pd_ file)


***
### Inlet 2: Harmonic Amount 

**Info:** Inlet 2 accepts atom values, corresponding to the amount of 7th chord harmonics added to the root tone

**Arguments:**
- _harmonicAmt_ - The amount of harmonics to be added (0-100)


Troubleshooting
===
If the external does not run in PD, or causes any issues, you may need to _recompile_ the included source code for your system. I recommend using [pd-lib-builder](https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder)
